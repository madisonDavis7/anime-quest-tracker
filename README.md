# 💖Anime Quest Tracker #

A cross platform app to track what anime you're watching and find new anime to watch. The app will allw you to see the progress of your currently watching anime, add new ones to your watchlist, and add ratings. 

This is a personal project I am doing to teach me the basics of React, mobile development, API usage, and everything else for a full stack project. My intention is to break the process up into week long sprints, with the goal to get this done in a month. 

## Tech Stack: ##
* React  react Native for frontend
* Expo for mobile development
* .NET SDK for backend
* SQL Server Express and SSMS for database stuff
* Postman for testing endpoints

# Challenges #
* I had several issues getting my environment setup, dependencies installed, and testing the connection between the frontend and backend. After several hours of looking up error messages, updating to the latest versions of everything, and reinstalling Node.js, the project was set up successfully. It was frstrating needing so much time for step one but was a learning process in terms of preparing for a fullstack app.
